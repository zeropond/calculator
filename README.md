# Zcash Mining Calculator

This project's goal is to provide standard metrics for Zcash mining performance.  The Zcash PoW is called Equihash, and each run of the algorithm generates more than one possible hash.  So we measure Equihash performance in terms of solutions per second (sol/s).  We will also aim to provide estimates of the global hashrate from the difficulty and block intervals.
